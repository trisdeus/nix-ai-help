# Copilot Instructions for the nixai Project

## Project Purpose
- nixai is a modular, console-based Linux application for solving NixOS configuration problems and assisting with NixOS setup and troubleshooting from the command line.
- Supports direct AI-powered help via `nixai "question"` or `nixai --ask "question"`.
- Integrates multiple LLMs (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.), defaulting to local Ollama for privacy, with user-selectable providers.
- Leverages an MCP server to query NixOS documentation from multiple official and community sources.
- Parses log outputs, accepts piped logs, executes and diagnoses local NixOS commands, and supports CLI-driven workflows.
- Modular submodules for community, packaging, learning, devenv, neovim, machines, and more.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use idiomatic Go and modular design for all code.
- All configuration is loaded from YAML (see `configs/default.yaml`) via the `internal/config` package.
- Use `internal/ai` for all LLM interactions. All providers must implement both `Query` and `GenerateResponse` methods. Allow user/provider selection and fallback.
- Use `internal/mcp` for documentation queries, always using sources from config.
- Use `internal/nixos` for log parsing, diagnostics, and NixOS command execution.
- Use `pkg/logger` for all logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for utility functions (file checks, string helpers, formatting, etc.).
- All CLI commands and logic must be in `internal/cli`. Each submodule may have its own Copilot instructions.
- Main entrypoint: `cmd/nixai/main.go`.
- All new features must be testable and documented.

## Features to Support
- **Direct Question Assistant**: Answer questions via `nixai "question"` or `--ask`/`-a` flag, using the provider's `Query` method.
- **Log & Config Diagnostics**: Diagnose NixOS issues from logs, configs, or piped input using LLMs.
- **Documentation Query**: Query NixOS docs from:
  - https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_Wiki
  - https://nix.dev/manual/nix
  - https://nix.dev/ 
  - https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/
  - https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/language/
  - https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/
- **NixOS Command Execution**: Run and parse local NixOS commands.
- **AI Provider Selection**: User can select/configure AI provider (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).
- **Package Repository Analysis**: Analyze Git repos and generate Nix derivations with `package-repo` command.
- **NixOS Option Explainer**: Explain NixOS options with `explain-option` command.
- **Home Manager Option Support**: Explain Home Manager options with `explain-home-option` command.
- **Community, Learning, Devenv, Machines, Neovim**: Modular commands for each area, each with its own help menu and Copilot instructions.
- **CLI Help Menus**: All commands must provide clear, formatted, actionable help menus with examples.
- **Piped Input**: Accept logs/configs via pipe or file for analysis.
- **Progress Indicators**: Show progress during API calls and long operations.

## Best Practices
- Keep code modular, well-documented, and testable.
- Prefer local inference (Ollama) for privacy, fallback to cloud LLMs if needed.
- Validate and sanitize all user/log input.
- Use context and idiomatic error handling throughout.
- Format terminal output with `glamour` and `utils` formatting helpers (`FormatHeader`, `FormatKeyValue`, `FormatDivider`, etc.).
- For direct questions, always use the provider's `Query` method.
- Gracefully handle MCP server unavailability.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- All new commands and features must be reflected in help menus and documentation.

## Testing & Build
- Use the `justfile` for build, test, lint, and run tasks.
- Use Nix (`flake.nix`) for reproducible builds and dev environments.
- All features must be covered by tests; update or add tests as needed.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` and `docs/MANUAL.md` for all new features, commands, and changes.
- Keep this instruction file and all submodule `.instructions.md` files up to date.
- Document both direct question and flag-based interfaces, with examples in README and manual.
- Each submodule should have its own Copilot instructions reflecting its responsibilities and integration points.

## AI Provider Integration
- All providers (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) must implement both `Query` and `GenerateResponse` methods.
- Default to Ollama with `llama3` model if not specified.
- Format prompts consistently across providers.
- API keys must be kept in environment variables, never in config files.

## Terminal UI
- Use `utils.FormatHeader`, `utils.FormatKeyValue`, `utils.FormatDivider`, and other formatting utilities for all output.
- Use `glamour` for Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting.
- Show progress indicators for API calls and long-running operations.
- All CLI commands must provide clear, actionable help menus with usage examples.

> These instructions are for all Copilot models and contributors. Follow them to ensure consistency, maintainability, and feature completeness for the nixai project. All submodules must have their own up-to-date `.instructions.md` files. When answering questions about frameworks, libraries, or APIs, use Context7 to retrieve current documentation rather than relying on training data.
